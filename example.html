    <h1 style="font-size:10vw;"> This is h1 text at 10vw</h1>
    <p> You can see that the above text is far bigger, and the text below is only slightly
        bigger, 10% of the screen is far bigger than you might think, so unless you aim to 
        not just capture the viewers attention but to also dominate it, then that is most
        likely the best way to do it. Upon resizing the screen, this paragraph should also
        resize itself to occupy the entire width of the screen. This is done through the
        tag in the header: < meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" >
    </p>
    <h2 style="font-size:5vw;"> This is a piece of text at 5vw, 5% of the viewport width</h2>
    <img src="sonic.jpg" style="max-width:33%;height:auto;">
    <img src="sonic.jpg" style="max-width:33%;height:auto;">
    <img src="sonic.jpg" style="max-width:33%;height:auto;">
    <p2> By scaling the images above to be "max-width:33%", 3 of the images are able to mostly 
        fit well onto the page</p2>
